# ms-comment
Team 'Head Over The Clouds' is recreating soundcloud's song page.  
I have been tasked with creating the comment component. Each artist
can comment on any song and have their comments replied to.

Requirements
An nvmrc file is included if using nvm.
* Node 6.13.0
* mysql

How to start webpack?
Run the following command: 'npm run dev:react'

How to start the server?

How to seed the database?

Run the following command: 'npm run db:setup'
This will setup the database schema and seed the database with initial data.
